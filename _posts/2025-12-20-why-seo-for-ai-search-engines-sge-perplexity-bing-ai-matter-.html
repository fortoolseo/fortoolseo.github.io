    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As we're living in the midst of the AI revolution, it's no surprise that AI search engines like SGE, Perplexity, and Bing AI are changing the game. We're talking about a future where machines can understand our queries and provide answers like never before. But have you ever stopped to think about how these AI search engines are going to rank and organize their results? That's where SEO (Search Engine Optimization) comes in, and it's more crucial than ever in 2025.</p>
<p>SEO for AI search engines may seem like a niche topic, but trust me, it's a game-changer. In this post, we'll dive into the world of AI search engines and explore why SEO matters now more than ever.</p>
