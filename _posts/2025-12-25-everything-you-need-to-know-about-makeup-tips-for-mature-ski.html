<h3>Step 2: Apply Foundation</h3>

<p>Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone, and apply it with a gentle, sweeping motion. Don't cake it on - instead, build up coverage gradually until you reach the desired level of coverage.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Conceal Imperfections</h3>

<h3>Step 5: Define Your Eyes</h3>

<p>Use a soft brown or neutral eyeshadow to create a subtle, everyday look. Apply it all over your lid, from lash line to crease, and blend it in thoroughly to avoid any harsh lines.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Finish with a Lip Balm</h3>

<p>Choose a lip balm that's moisturizing and non-greasy, and apply it to keep your lips hydrated and soft.</p>
