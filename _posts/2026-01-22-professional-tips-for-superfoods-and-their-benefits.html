<h2>How to Do it</h2>
<h3>Finding Superfoods in Your Diet</h3>
<p>So, where do you start? The good news is that you don't need to break the bank or become a nutritionist to incorporate superfoods into your diet. Start by making small changes to your daily routine:</p>

<p>Here's a simple tip: aim to include a rainbow of colors on your plate. This is a great way to ensure you're getting a variety of vitamins and minerals in your diet.</p>

<h3>Preparing Superfoods for Maximum Benefits</h3>
<p>Now that you're incorporating superfoods into your diet, it's essential to prepare them in a way that maximizes their benefits:</p>
