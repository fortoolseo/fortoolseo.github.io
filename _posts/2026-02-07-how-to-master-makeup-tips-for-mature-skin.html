    <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mastering makeup tips for mature skin is a game-changer, especially if you're over 40 and feeling self-conscious about fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone.

Hyperpigmentation, rosacea, and dryness become more prevalent, making it harder to achieve that smooth, even base. But don't worry, we're not here to dwell on the negatives. Instead, we're going to focus on the positives - how to enhance your natural beauty, rather than covering it up.</p>
